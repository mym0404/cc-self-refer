# Plan Resolve - View and Load Strategic Plans

View, search, and load existing strategic planning documents for implementation reference.

**Usage**: `/plan-resolve <id|keyword>`

## Purpose

This command retrieves and displays strategic plans by utilizing the `cc-self-refer` CLI tool's plan viewing functionality.

## Implementation

Execute the `npx -y cc-self-refer plan view` command:

```bash
npx -y cc-self-refer plan view <id_or_keyword> --context
```

Examples:

```bash
npx -y cc-self-refer plan view 3 --context
npx -y cc-self-refer plan view "authentication" --context
npx -y cc-self-refer plan list  # List all plans
```

**Note**: The `--context` flag formats plan output for AI consumption with strategic insights and implementation guidance.

This will:

- Find and display the requested plan
- Show full plan content with formatting
- Load plan context for implementation reference

## Usage Examples

### View by Plan ID

```bash
/plan-resolve 3
```

### Search by Keyword

```bash
/plan-resolve authentication
```

### List All Plans

```bash
/plan-resolve
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reference**: Check relevant plans before starting implementation
2. **Context Loading**: Use `--context` flag when working on plan-related tasks
3. **Keyword Search**: Use descriptive terms for faster plan discovery
4. **ID Bookmarking**: Remember frequently accessed plan IDs

## Error Handling

- **Invalid ID**: Shows available plan IDs
- **No Keyword Matches**: Suggests similar terms and lists available plans
- **File Access Issues**: Reports file system problems with resolution steps
- **Empty Plans Directory**: Guides user to create first plan

## Performance Notes

- **Fast ID Access**: Direct ID lookups are instantaneous
- **Efficient Search**: Keyword search uses optimized indexing
- **Context Processing**: `--context` flag adds minimal processing overhead
- **Batch Operations**: List operations are optimized for large plan collections
