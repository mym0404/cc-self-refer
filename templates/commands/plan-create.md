# Plan Create - Create New Strategic Planning Document

Create comprehensive strategic planning documents with structured templates.

**Usage**: `/plan-create <task-name> <description>`

## What does this command do

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: CLI Command Execution Required

**This command MUST execute the following `cc-self-refer` CLI command.**

### CLI Command Used

```bash
npx -y cc-self-refer plan create "<task-name>" "<description>"
```

### Command Arguments
- `task-name`: Name of the strategic plan/task
- `description`: Initial description or overview of the plan

### Expected Output
- Creates a new strategic plan with auto-incremented numbering
- Generates comprehensive plan template with structured sections
- Saves to `.claude/plans/<number>-<sanitized-name>.md`
- Returns plan filename for reference

## Purpose

This command creates new strategic planning documents by utilizing the `cc-self-refer` CLI tool's plan creation functionality.

## Plan Document Example Structure

```markdown
# <Number>. <Original Task Name>

## Usage Examples

### Creating New Plan

```bash
/plan-create "Dark Mode Implementation" "Feature allowing users to switch between light/dark themes"
```

Claude will:

1. Ask about UI framework and CSS approach
2. Inquire about persistence requirements
3. Clarify scope and components affected
4. Generate comprehensive planning document

## Interactive Question Examples

**Feature Development**:

- "Which UI framework are you using?"
- "How should it integrate with the existing system?"
- "Are there any performance requirements?"
- "Which browsers need to be supported?"

**Bug Fix Planning**:

- "What symptoms are appearing?"
- "Since when has the issue been occurring?"
- "Which components are affected?"
- "Is there a reproducible scenario?"

**API Optimization**:

- "What is the current response time?"
- "What are the target performance metrics?"
- "Is there caching infrastructure?"
- "What are the traffic patterns?"

## Directory Management

- **Creation**: Ensure `.claude/plans/` exists
- **Naming**: Auto-numbered with descriptive names
- **Organization**: Sequential numbering for easy reference

## Error Handling

- **Missing Directory**: Create `.claude/plans/` automatically
- **File Conflicts**: Handle gracefully with user confirmation

## Best Practices

1. **Creating Plans**:
   - Provide detailed initial description
   - Answer Claude's questions thoroughly
   - Review generated plan before finalizing
