# Plan Create - Create New Implementation Planning Document

Create comprehensive planning to implement specific product specification or requirement and run cli.

**Usage**: `/plan-create <plan-name> <description>`

## What does this command do

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CLI Command Execution Required

**This command MUST execute the following `cc-self-refer` CLI command.**

### Process Flow
1. Claude Code asks clarifying questions about the plan
2. Claude Code generates a comprehensive plan template based on requirements
3. Claude Code executes the CLI command to save the plan

### CLI Command Used

```bash
npx -y cc-self-refer plan create "<title>" <<'EOF'
<full-plan-content>
EOF
```

### Command Arguments
- `title`: Title of the plan
- `full-plan-content`: Complete markdown content of the plan (generated by Claude Code with template)

## Plan Document Template

```markdown
# <Task Name>

## Overview
[Concise description of what needs to be done, why it's needed, and expected outcome]

## Implementation
[Detailed technical implementation including:
- Framework/library choices and versions
- Specific files to create/modify with exact paths
- Code snippets or pseudo-code for core logic
- Package dependencies to install
- API endpoints or interfaces to implement
- Database schema changes if needed
- Configuration and environment variables]

## Todo List
- [ ] [Specific action item 1]
- [ ] [Specific action item 2]
- [ ] [Specific action item 3]
- [ ] [Additional tasks as needed]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Test or validation requirement]

## References
- Pattern #[N]: [Brief description if needed]
- Spec #[N]: [Spec title or topic]
- Page #[N]: [Previous session topic]
- File: `path/to/relevant/file.ts`
- Docs: [External documentation link if needed]
```

### Example Plan

```markdown
# Fix Memory Leak in WebSocket Handler

## Overview
Resolve memory leak causing server crashes after 24 hours of operation. Event listeners are not being properly cleaned up on disconnect.

## Implementation
**Root Cause:** Event listeners not removed on socket disconnect
**Affected Service:** WebSocket server (`src/services/websocket.ts`)

**Fix approach:**
```typescript
// Add cleanup in disconnect handler
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  socket.removeAllListeners();
  clearInterval(heartbeatInterval);
  delete activeSockets[socket.id];
});
```

**Memory profiling:**
- Use Chrome DevTools for heap snapshots
- Monitor with `process.memoryUsage()`

## Todo List
- [ ] Add memory profiling logs
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup handlers
- [ ] Test with connection stress tool
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours in staging
- [ ] Deploy fix to production

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory usage stable over 48 hours
- [ ] No orphaned event listeners in heap dumps
- [ ] Server handles 10k connect/disconnect cycles

### Plan Flexibility Guide

**The Implementation section should adapt to your task type:**

- **Feature Development**: Frameworks, libraries, new files to create
- **Bug Fixes**: Root cause analysis, specific code changes
- **Performance**: Metrics, optimization strategies, benchmarks  
- **Refactoring**: Architecture changes, migration steps
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, deployment settings
- **Integration**: API endpoints, authentication, data flow

**Keep it practical:** Include only what's needed for execution. Skip sections if they don't apply.

## Usage Examples

### Create Plan Examples

When user requests:

```bash
/plan-create "implement rate limiting" "prevent API abuse with Redis-based rate limiting"
```

Claude will:

1. Generate plan content using the template above with Overview, Implementation, Todo List, Success Criteria, and References sections
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   npx -y cc-self-refer plan create "implement rate limiting" <<'EOF'
   <generated plan content>
   EOF
   ```
