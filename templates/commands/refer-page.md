# Refer Page - Load Session History Context

Retrieve and load session history from `.claude/pages/` directory by timestamp, keyword, or partial name search.

**Usage**: `/refer-page <timestamp|keyword>`

## Purpose

This command retrieves saved session histories to restore context from previous development sessions. It enables continuity across multiple sessions and helps recover important development context and decisions.

## Implementation

Use the `cc-self-refer` CLI tool to efficiently search and load session pages:

```bash
npx -y cc-self-refer page view <id_or_keyword> --context
npx -y cc-self-refer page search <keyword> --context
npx -y cc-self-refer page list
```

**Note**: The `--context` flag formats output for AI consumption with enhanced metadata and structured content.

### Search Process

The CLI tool handles:

- **Directory Management**: Automatically checks `.claude/pages/` directory
- **Smart Search**: Supports both exact ID matches and keyword searches
- **Content Matching**: Searches in filenames and content
- **Relevance Ranking**: Returns results sorted by relevance score
- **Context Loading**: Displays full page content for reference

### 3. Output Format

**Single Match Found**:

```markdown
